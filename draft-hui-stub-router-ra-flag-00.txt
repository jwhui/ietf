        Stub Router Flag in ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Messages
                    draft-hui-stub-router-ra-flag-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new Stub Router flag in the Router
   Advertisement message to distinguish configuration information sent
   by stub routers from infrastructure routers.  For example, the Stub
   Router flag allows stub routers to easily identify when an
   infrastructure router is advertising a usable IPv6 prefix, triggering
   the stub router to not advertise its own routable prefix.

1.  Introduction

   A stub router provides IP connectivity between a stub network and an
   infrastructure network.  A common stub router example is a device
   that attaches a 6LoWPAN-based network to a home network.

   To support IPv6 reachability between infrastructure network devices
   and stub network devices, routable IPv6 addresses must be configured
   on both the infrastructure and stub networks.  Routers on the
   infrastructure network may configure routable IPv6 prefixes using
   Router Advertisements (RAs) containing Prefix Information Options
   (PIOs) [RFC4861].

   In cases where the infrastructure network does not provide routable
   IPv6 address configuration, the stub router is responsible for
   configuring routable IPv6 addresses on the infrastructure network.
   If a stub router determines that routable IPv6 addresses are not
   available on the infrastructure link, it will locally generate a
   Unique Local Address (ULA) Prefix [RFC4193] and begin advertising
   that via a PIO contained in RA messages.

   Both infrastructure routers and stub routers may advertise routable
   IPv6 prefixes in the same way (via RAs containing PIOs).  To
   distinguish between an infrastructure router and a stub router, this
   document defines a new Stub Router flag in the RA message.  The Stub
   Router flag allows stub routers to easily identify when an
   infrastructure router is advertising a routable IPv6 prefix,
   triggering the stub router to stop advertising its ULA prefix.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Stub Router Flag

   This document defines a new "Stub Router" flag as flag bit 8 in the
   Router Advertisement flags field.  Setting the Stub Router flag
   requires use of the RA Flags Extension Option [RFC5175] to encode the
   flag.

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.  Router Advertisement Transmission

   A stub router that is not explicitly configured as part of the
   infrastructure network MUST set the Stub Router flag in outgoing RA
   messages.

   How and when a stub router includes PIOs in outgoing RAs is specified
   in [I-D.lemon-stub-networks].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a flag from the "IPv6 ND Router
   Advertisement flags" registry of [RFC5175], as specified below:

         +---------------+----------------------+---------------+
         | RA Option Bit | Description          | Reference     |
         +---------------+----------------------+---------------+
         | 8             | S - Stub Router Flag | This Document |
         +---------------+----------------------+---------------+

                                 Table 1

   Note that RA Option Bit 8 requires use of the RA Flags Extension
   Option [RFC5175] to encode the flag.

6.  Security Considerations

   This protocol shares the security issues of NDP that are documented
   in the "Security Considerations" section of [RFC4861].
